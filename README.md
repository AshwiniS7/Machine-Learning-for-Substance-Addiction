# MachineLearning-Python
Python code for predictive models

The code in this repository contains files that are used to learn and predict addiction to Cocaine, Marijuana, Heroin and Alcohol, and the recurrence of these addictions.Three models are built: Decision tree, Random forest and Logistic Regression, are built using Python libraries numPy, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib and seaborn. A dataset from ICPSR containing demographic information (65 features) of ~900K patients who suffered from substance addiction and their recurrence is used for training and prediction. Important features are also extracted from these models.
