Python code for predictive models

These files contain Python code with scikit learn packages for building predictive models.
Three models are built: Decision tree, Random forest and Logistic Regression.
A dataset from ICPSR containing demographic information of subjects who suffered from substance addiction 
and their recurrence is used for training and prediction.
Important features are also extracted from these models.
